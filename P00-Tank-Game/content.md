In this tutorial, we'll build a VR game in which you control a Tank from the cockpit!

Amongst other things, you'll learn how to:

- create camera-projected surfaces using Render textures
- how to move levers with your hands

If you'd like to see what the final project will be like, you can check it out by cloning and opening this package:

```
git clone https://MakeSchool-Tutorials@bitbucket.org/MakeSchool-Tutorials/tanks-unity-vr.git
```

Let's get started!
