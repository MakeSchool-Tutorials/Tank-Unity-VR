Congratulations! You did it!

If you'd like more challenges to test your newfound skills, you may enjoy trying any of the following:
- Implementing health that, when depleted, makes a tank respawn at its start position.
- Adding more effects and sounds!
- Improving the enemy AI.
- Preventing the player from being able to go up walls or flip over.
- Adding a reload time to the launch button for the player to prevent spamming the button.

We hope you enjoyed the tutorial ;)

Happy VRing!
